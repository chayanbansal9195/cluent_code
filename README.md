# Cluent (Cluster Based Discount)
Cluent- An efficient way of targeted advertisement of offline stores.

## Technology in Brand Experience

Brand experience is a type of experiential marketing that
incorporates a holistic set of condition created by a company
to influence the feeling a customer has about a particular
product of a company.

## Our Solution - Cluent

● Cluent- An efficient way of targeted advertisement of offline stores. Instead
of using traditional way of giving low discounts and coupons to the masses
we will supply heavy discount to the group of people which will give a
maximum profit to the store. <br>
● We will target those stores which has stored the history of individual
customers. We will use that history to calculate the spending score of each
customer.<br>
● We will assign each customer a cluster based on their income and spending
score. And the shopkeeper will assign coupons to each cluster. The coupons
given to the clusters will be different as compared to others, to encourage
the potential high value customers to spend more.

## Motto

```
login Shop Save
```

## Services- Dataflow for Shopkeeper

● The first time when the shopkeeper launches the application we
will ask for an account to be created, where the shopkeeper will
verify his email and set a password. Then we will ask to create a
page for his shop, where he will upload the basic information we
need.<br>
● Then he will receive a list of all his customers, along with the
cluster to which each corresponding customers belong to.<br>
● Then he will be informed about the custer that are made and what
is the significance of each cluster.<br>
● Then on that basis the shopkeeper can assign the discount he want.

## Services- Dataflow for Admins

● When a shop logs in and the necessary information is
uploaded then the admin side is responsible to use that
information to divide the customers into clusters and
give the data back to the shopkeeper.<br>
● When the admin receives the discount information from
the shopkeeper, then at the time of billing the
customer’s cluster is identified and the appropriate
discount is applied.

## Services - Dataflow for Customers

● When the customer logs in he will first have to upload his basic
information.<br>
● He can join a outlet by getting the invite code from a shopkeeper.<br>
● Each shop will have a unique joining code.<br>
● Upon joining the history of that customer will be taken from the
shop and the basic info will be taken from the customer’s login, then
using that data we will assign a specific cluster to the customer and
the customer will get discounts based on the cluster assigned.

## Business Model

● According to customers shopping from a shop from our
database we can monetize it.<br>
● Each shop will have to pay a dynamic fees for each
customer.<br>
● There will be benefits like to get our service for 1 year or
so to avail a paying fees reduce by some percent each
customer, If a sum of amount is paid in advance.

## Future Buisness Model

After the platform is deployed for a few stored for a considered amount of time, we would have collected a <u>significant amount of dataset.</u>

That dataset will contain the information like <u>shopping category and the price range of the products each customer buys</u>.

That dataset can be used by an <u>upcoming or new business</u> to boost it's sales.

So we are not just <u>earning by the usage of the portal</u> in general, even <u>data going through our portal</u> will help in <u>generating royalty.</u>

## Social Values

● Customers can keep track of their purchase history in
one application.<br>
● Can check how much they spend each day and filter it
according to month.<br>
● Shopkeepers can track their most valuable and less
valuable customers.<br>
● The whole application will work as a data centred flow
model in all together.
